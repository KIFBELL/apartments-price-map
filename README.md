# pet-project
This is a pet project which is designed to get an opportunity to work with pandas, geopandas, and selenium libs.

The code serves you with the average price of a squared meter of apartments in 3 Russian cities, namely Moscow, SPB, and Ekaterinburg.
The final result would be a heat map that provide a user with a price data.

If you want to try it out, then, please:
1. [download](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads?authuser=0) the chromedriver which suits your os;
2. put it into a diriectory with parsing.py and heat_map.ipynb files;
3. you'd also need to put "forAnalysis" folder at the same location.

Then work with heat_map.ipynb (parsing.py is only a local lib that helps you download files from cian.ru)
